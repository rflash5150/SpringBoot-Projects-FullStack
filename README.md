We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

>> Features <<
* Create stand-alone Spring applications

* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

* Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration

* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
