##
We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and several-party libraries so you can get started with as Spring Boot Core. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

##  Features 
* Create stand-alone Spring applications

* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

* Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration

* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
